Paper can review models and main phenomena of narrative comprehension AND free recall, focusing on offline products but also connecting to encoding dynamics.

Focus on centrality and its role especially in recent analyses/modeling of offline comprehension products.

Also focus of course on temporal organization and relevant benchmarks.

Announced plans:

1. To show that neither CMr nor LS-R nor even semantic-CMR satisfactorily account for both relevant semantic and temporal organizational phenomena. 

2. To present an integrated model of how retrieved context theory and comprehension mechanisms interact to organize offline recall.

3. To leverage, for the first time, a likelihood-based analysis of the model's capacity to account for the sequence of recalls to support these comparisons.

4. To connect these results to novel predictions about the dynamics of comprehension and memory and point the way forward to more...parsimonious models.
