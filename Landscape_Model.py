# # The Revised Landscape Model
#
# Here we reproduce the revision of the Landscape model of reading comprehension presented by Yeari and van den Broek (2016). The model integrates the dynamic landscape model of reading comprehension originally characterized by van den Broek (1996) with a latent semantic analysis (LSA) representation of semantic knowledge. This revised landscape model (LS-R model) computes fluctuations in the activation of text units and the interconnections established between them throughout reading. Our implemention of the landscape model is, however, agnostic about the basis of representations of semantic knowledge.

class LandscapeRevised:
    """
    The landscape model of reading as revised by Yeari and van den Broek (1996).
    To encode a text into the model, it is initially segmented into text units 
    (e.g., words or propositions) and reading cycles (e.g., clauses or  
    sentences) depending on researcher preference. Similarly, semantic 
    connections between all text units are also computed before model 
    initialization. In the original specification of LS-R, semantic 
    connections are computed using LSA, but we leave configuration of initial 
    semantic connections separate from the model. This revised landscape model 
    computes fluctuations in the _activation_ of text units and in the 
    _interconnections_ established between them throughout reading.
    
    Basic Parameters:  
    - connections: array, initial connection strengths between text units  
    - max_activity: maximum activation that units are allowed to have  
    - min_activity: minimum activation that units are allowed to have  
    - decay_rate: decay rate of unit activation from one cycle to next  
    - memory_capacity: total activation possible in any given cycle  
    - learning_rate: rate of connection weight changes across cycles  
    - semantic_strength: relative contribution of initial semantic  
        connections to computation of overall connection strengths  
    
    Retrieval Parameters (imported from CMR, only relevant for free recall):  
    - stop_probability_scale
    - stop_probability_growth
    - choice_sensitivity
    
    Attributes:
    - activations: vector, current activation of each relevant text unit
    - connections: array, current connection strengths between text units

        Activations are updated as a function of three simulated mechanisms:  
        1. attention: units of the current cycle are activated to the 
            highest value  
        2. working memory: units from prior cycles carry residual activation 
            (following a decay rule)  
        3. long-term memory: units from prior cycles are reactivated via
            connections with text units that are active in the current cycle. 
            
        Episodic connections are added to and augment baseline connection 
        strengths throughout the dynamic flow from one reading cycle to the 
        next. They are formed between text units that are coactivated (due to 
        any activation mechanism) in the same reading cycle. The strength of 
        episodic connections is a function of the activation levels of the 
        interconnected text units, and it accumulates with each concurrent 
        activation (following a logarithmic learning rule).
