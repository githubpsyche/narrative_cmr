Let's try only doing the dual-representation thing inside my workspace directory. Whenever I want to worked on a synced dual representation, I can move a file to the workspace where it belongs. And then when I pick a representation to move elsewhere, I no longer have to worry about syncing. And to avoid worrying about syncing entirely, I can just make a notebook and chill out. God I kinda hate all these suggestions.

Oh my god, It's Gistpad making the stupid suggestions. Can I turn those off?

I think maybe I'm overcomplicating things here.

I like tabnine but not gistpad's suggestions. If I can't turn them off, then gistpad has got to go. TabNine's suggestions help me finish a sentence even when I don't accept them. Gistpad disrupts that flow.

Tabnine's suggestions work even in notebooks, so I don't have to ditch Jupyter to make use of them.

I still want to be able to version control my notebooks and use them with Gitlens and Github Pull Requests/Issues, though!

What about Gitdoc? Do I want my code to autocommit on save? Gitdoc with something that reminds me of my commit history in the context of my editing could be very useful and also help maintain context by reminding me of my change history. 

But again, I don't think any of these features work with Jupyter, and I'm finding that the Python and Markdown editors just don't cut it for the large files I'm interested in working on. So do I give up?

This seems great. From the first commit I already have tons of information about my commit history and whatnot. Do I or do I not have this for notebooks?

Even if I love the notebook interface, I feel increasingly sure I don't want notebooks to be the main source for my files here!

**I need highlighting here**. Like actual highlighting.

Wait there's a reason I turned off gistpad. It's these weird suggestions
