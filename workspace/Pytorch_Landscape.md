# The Revised Landscape Model

Here we reproduce the revision of the Landscape model of reading comprehension presented by Yeari and van den Broek (2016). The model integrates the dynamic landscape model of reading comprehension originally characterized by van den Broek (1996) with a latent semantic analysis (LSA) representation of semantic knowledge. This revised landscape model (LS-R model) computes fluctuations in the activation of text units and the interconnections established between them throughout reading. Our implemention of the landscape model is, however, agnostic about the basis of representations of semantic knowledge.

    The landscape model of reading as revised by Yeari and van den Broek (1996).
    To encode a text into the model, it is initially segmented into text units 
    (e.g., words or propositions) and reading cycles (e.g., clauses or  
    sentences) depending on researcher preference. Similarly, semantic 
    connections between all text units are also computed before model 
    initialization. In the original specification of LS-R, semantic 
    connections are computed using LSA, but we leave configuration of initial 
    semantic connections separate from the model. This revised landscape model 
    computes fluctuations in the _activation_ of text units and in the 
    _interconnections_ established between them throughout reading.
