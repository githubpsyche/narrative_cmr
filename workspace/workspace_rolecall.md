# Workspace Roll Call 07_07_2021

## What Are These Files in My Workspace?
I sure waste a lot of time asking myself that question a lot.

- `pytorch_landscape_model_draft.md`. The Pytorch-based implementation of the Landscape model volunteered by Aditya in Google colab. A decent reference but I couldn't wrap my head around it.

- `initial_temporal_effects_demo.py`. An early exploration of my approach to psifr where I leverage it to draw out initial dataframes and then chill.

- `first_attempt_landscape_simulations.py`. My first attempt at simulating the landscape model before feeling overwhelmed by the problem. I ended up revisiting/sanity checking my current pipeline by reproducing Becky's analyses. I also refactored the follow-up analyses into a separate notebook. Key lesson: if the task at hand is confusing, there may be prior tasks that you missed. If the task at hand is confusing, maybe you have other stuff cluttering your work context.

- `high_level_comprehension_and_memory_connections.py`. An attempt to lightly review the landscape model and the comprehension literature's relationship with CMR and associated work. Resolution is roughly that comprehension models offer an account of how semantic associations between idea units might evolve over the course of reading even as retrieved context theory accounts for how temporal associations might be constructed.

- `defunct_psifr_sbs_csv_examples.py`. Now pretty much defunct script exploring/confirming that the `psifr_sbs.csv` preprocessed data file I've been using actually works and can be manipulated to generate tables and whatnot. A useful reference, but I have better ones now, I think.

- `initial_poster_proposal.py`. A pretty critical outline of the initial set of analysis outcomes and ideas I'd have to convey in order to present a report about my landscape model work here. 

- `Enough_For_Poster.todo`. Todo list for approaching the specifications of my initial poster proposal. I finished it on time! But what was left? Literature Review, Methods and model diagrams, Model fits. Hence my priorities for the current push.

## What About the Main Files?
Are There Gaps I Need to Plug in So Far Finished Work?

00 to 01 are done. I'm happy with the data structure I'm working with. How about `02_Cutler_Poster_Reproduction.py`? I'm pretty happy with that as well. Kinda wonder if I should preserve complete analyses as notebooks? Eh. Save a copy in results and that's it.

How about `03_Representational_Clustering.py`? I'm perturbed by a few aspects of my initial results. First, some idea units have dramatically higher summed connectivities than others and this seems to throw off my analysis results, including my reproduction of the main Yeari et al (2016) analysis. I should figure out a way to troubleshoot that. 

Once I resolve that, though, there will be no remaining problem beyond the spectre of More Work To Do.
