Enough for Poster:
  ✔ Split landscape model specification from analysis code @5m @started(21-06-28 06:24) @done(21-06-28 06:29) @lasted(5m56s)
  Instead of splitting, I found it easier to just take advantage of what Python scripts are for; my original notebooks specifying the classes can be imported directly.

  ☐ Extend semantic organizational analyses to span models simulation increments

  ☐ Apply similar representational clustering analysis to CMR simulations. @2h

  ☐ Add and apply loss functions for model fitting @1h

  ☐ plot key temporal and semantic organizational analyses @1h

  ☐ Perform statistical comparisons of model performance @2h

Instance_CMR:
  ☐ Update Manuscript @4h
  I see 38 comments. If I spend an average of 5 minutes on each, that's 3.16hrs. I doubt I have the stamina.

  ☐ Regenerate Figures @4h
  Since I'm in the middle of a refactoring, this could take a long time if I'm not focused.

  ☐ New Analysies @4h
  Sean isn't asking for a lot here; as long as I have something, he'll appreciate it.

*Notes*
Refactor to center the poster reproduction as a core project increment? Yeah, let's abandon the old organization (Semantic Effects, Temporal Effects) and instead take a progressive approach (03_Cutler_Poster_Reproduction, 04_Representational_Clustering).

A flat design for To-Do Lists is probably preferable given the structure of the side panel. But maybe there are settings to help simplify this?
