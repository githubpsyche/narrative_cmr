  ✔ Split landscape model specification from analysis code @5m @started(21-06-28 06:24) @done(21-06-28 06:29) @lasted(5m56s)
  Instead of splitting, I found it easier to just take advantage of what Python scripts are for; my original notebooks specifying the classes can be imported directly.

  ☐ Extend semantic organizational analyses to span models simulation increments @3h
  

  ☐ Apply similar representational clustering analysis to CMR simulations. @2h
  The problem with this approach is that default parameters for CMR are way less established, and comparison between default models is ridiculous anyway. It's probably valuable for sanity checking to show that this analysis works for contrasting CMR with flat temporal organizational accounts of free recall too?

  ☐ Add and apply loss functions for model fitting @1h

  ☐ plot key temporal and semantic organizational analyses @1h

  ☐ Perform statistical comparisons of model performance @2h

Instance_CMR:
  ☐ Update Manuscript @4h
  I see 38 comments. If I spend an average of 5 minutes on each, that's 3.16hrs. I doubt I have the stamina.

  ☐ Regenerate Figures @4h
  Since I'm in the middle of a refactoring, this could take a long time if I'm not focused.

  ☐ New Analysies @4h
  Sean isn't asking for a lot here; as long as I have something, he'll appreciate it.

*Notes*
Refactor to center the poster reproduction as a core project increment? Yeah, let's abandon the old organization (Semantic Effects, Temporal Effects) and instead take a progressive approach (03_Cutler_Poster_Reproduction, 04_Representational_Clustering).
