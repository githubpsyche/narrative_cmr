> The chapter discusses that the structure of stories is ordinarily more than pair wise relationships among sentences, and strings of sentences combine into psychological wholes. It also explains the nature of these wholes and presents a simple story grammar that accounts for many of the salient facts about the structure of simple stories and that will serve as the basis for a theory of summarization. The grammar consists of a set of syntactical rules that generate the constituent structure of stories and a corresponding set of semantic interpretation rules that determine the semantic representation of the story. The symbol “+” is used to form two items in a sequence; the symbol “|” is used to separate mutually exclusive alternatives. A “*” following a structure name indicates one or more of those units; for example, A* is one or more As. In the semantic structures the convention is followed that the predicate names are written in the ovals and the arguments of the predicates are pointed to by arrows. The propositions that are the units of the story are simply numbered.
