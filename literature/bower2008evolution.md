> The author summarizes his evolving interests from conditioning studies within a behaviorist orientation, thence to human memory, knowledge representation, and narrative understanding and memory. Arguing that the study of skilled reading provides a microcosm for revealing cognitive processes [[Why Narratives]], he illustrates this by reviewing his research on the use of spatial priming to investigate readers’ on-line updating of their situational models of texts. Conceptual entities close to the reader's focus of attention within the model are readily retrieved. 

> Retrieval speed from memory declines with the probed object's distance from the current focus and decays with time elapsed in the narrative since the item was last in focus. The focus effect varies with the character's perspective, his status in the story, his active goals, and other factors. The results are accommodated within an associative network model distinguishing just-read sentences in short-term memory from activated portions of long-term memory structures to which they refer.

## [[Semantic Integration]]
Section: Organizational Factors in Memory, p5
> So my students and I studied the cognitive maneuvers that people use to learn and remember things (Bobrow & Bower 1969), Bower & Winzenz 1970). Many of us found that sheer repetition and rote rehearsal of an item in short-term memory was woefully insufficient for recording a more long-lasting memory. So what would accomplish this?

Bobrow and Bower 1969 is about recall of sentences, elaborative encoding. Same for Wizenz collaboration.

> My studies of organizational aids to memory were greatly influenced by the ideas of George Katona (1940) on how subjects’ “understanding” of materials promotes memory, of [[George Miller 1956]] on chunking, and of [[Endel Tulving 1962]] and [[George Mandler 1967]] on participants’ subjective organization in free recall. Tulving and Mandler studied how people learned to free-recall lists of “unrelated” words studied repeatedly. They found that adult subjects spontaneously look for meaningful relations among the items, grouping them into “chunks,” and perhaps even organizing the chunks into larger memory chunks. That prompted my research into the processes that created or disrupted chunks in memory [[(Bower 1970a]], [[Bower 1972]].

> We found that in learning to associate pairs of unrelated words, memory was greatly improved by instructing subjects to search out and form meaningful relationships between the items, such as might be expressed in a sentence—no matter how bizarre

> thesis that memory was an incidental byproduct of the person organizing the materials into a perceptual or conceptual unity or whole ([[Asch 1969]], [[Asch et al. 1960]]).

>  These studies of associative learning via conceptual or imagery combinations became a popular trend of the times, and were in sympathy with the contemporaneous “depth of processing” metaphor of [[Craik & Lockhart 1972]], [[Craik & Tulving 1975]]).


We have to distinguish this from the idea that the semantic similarity between two concepts corresponds with association in memory. Instead, in this phenomenon, two semantically dissimilar concepts are deliberately linked with one another. In a sense, this is the core memory phenomenon that a theory of narrative recall must address. That's why I'm so invested in the idea of dynamic semantic connections. 

But Bower doesn't directly relate this to any empirical phenomena in narrative memory; it's the whole she-bang.

## [[Story Grammars]]
> After a few minor studies of text memory ([[Bower 1974]], [[Bower 1978]]), my student, Perry Thorndyke, and I became attracted to the story-grammar approach to understanding (Bower 1976, Thorndyke 1977). Simple stories and folktales contain such recurring components as a setting, characters, a theme (main goal), a plot, episodes, and a resolution. Colby 1973 and Rumelhart 1975 even conjectured that there might be something like a context-free story grammar. That is, some rewrite rules would specify how large narrative components would be expressed in terms of smaller constituents or terminal elements.

[[Colby, B. N. (1973). A Partial Grammar of Eskimo Folktales 1. American anthropologist, 75(3), 645-662.]]
Colby 1973 is an anthropological paper that tries to identify a story grammar for Eskimo folktales. Leaving that a lone.
The Bower 1978 paper is indeed not very influential.
The Rumelhart 1975 paper seems incredibly influential. But I can't find a PDF!

> Our early research showed that adults not only prefer stories that follow the canonical grammar but also recall them far better than they do randomly scrambled sentences (Bower 1976, Thorndyke 1977)

[[Bower, G. H. (1976). Experiments on story understanding and recall. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 28(4), 511-534.]]

[[Thorndyke, P. W. (1977). Cognitive structures in comprehension and memory of narrative discourse. Cognitive psychology, 9(1), 77-110.]]

>  Furthermore, when summarizing a story, people typically recite the “higher” units of the grammatical hierarchy by naming the main characters, main setting, main goal, and main outcome. In other words, as the grammar expected, people recall the essential gist of the story, while letting go of lesser details. Kintsch (1974) similarly found that people recall the main points (generalizations) rather than finer details of expository text. This and other research (e.g., Mandler & Johnson 1977, Stein 1988) established that people in our culture acquire and use a schema that allows them to identify the principal elements of a well-formed narrative and how these elements are structured. This schema also guides their later recall of the narrative.

Kintsh 1974 is a full book. I'll avoid it.

[[Mandler, J. M., & Johnson, N. S. (1977). Remembrance of things parsed: Story structure and recall. Cognitive psychology, 9(1), 111-151.]]

Good but not "central to literature" good.

Can't find the Stein paper.

## Goal-Organized Recall
In story grammar section p9:
> A crucial element for recall is the overall goal of the protagonist. If no overall goal is expressed or strongly implied, comprehension and recall plummet. Comprehension also suffers if subgoals, actions, and outcomes are spread out and misaligned over different episodes of the story.

## Limitations of Story Grammar Theory
- Theory is content-free. Research like that reviewed by Bower 1976 / Thorndike 1977 confirms content matters too!
- Not really clearly linked to mechanism. Doesn't engage with role that reader's inferences play in understanding. Story grammar theory begins with the text, so ends up having too little to say about the process of comprehension/memory.

## Three-Level View of Event Understanding
> Dating from van Dijk & Kintsch (1983), researchers have developed the consensus that as people read or hear a story about events, a cascade of different cognitive processes go on in parallel, building multilevel representations of the information. First, readers take in the surface structure of the printed (or spoken) sentences and hold it in their working memory for several seconds. From this surface structure, they extract a propositional text base containing the logical relations between the concepts and the predicates stated in the text. Finally, a referential representation of what the text is about is constructed.

I got enough about the story grammar idea and enough to critique it. Now for the situation model approach.

[[Van Dijk, T. A., & Kintsch, W. (1983). Strategies of discourse comprehension.]]

This is a whole book again. I don't want to be responsible for something of that scale.

[[Morrow, D. G., Bower, G. H., & Greenspan, S. L. (1989). Updating situation models during narrative comprehension. Journal of memory and language, 28(3), 292-312.]]

Over 500 citations, and a clear example of an effect discovered using the whole situation model theory. Includes situation distance effects for story location and protagonist perspective.

[[Bower, G. H., & Morrow, D. G. (1990). Mental models in narrative comprehension. Science, 247(4938), 44-48.]]

Seems to review the same results. Or review results collected across the same experimental approach. More cited too (well, just by 200). Might be a better higher-level review.

[[Johnson-Laird, P. N. (1983). Mental models: Towards a cognitive science of language, inference, and consciousness (No. 6). Harvard University Press.]]

A whole book. I hope this guy's okay.

## Causal Analyses of Motives, Actions, and Outcomes
> A major clue about a situational change is a change in the characters’ goals—their achievement, frustration, or failure. Therefore, I moved my research increasingly from full-blown stories to concentrate on how people recognize and understand characters’ motives, plans, and actions (Black & Bower 1980; Bower 1978, 1983; Foss & Bower 1986). The causal linkages among these elements heavily influence a reader’s representation of the meaning of the narrative. Tracking a reader’s understanding of characters’ plans and goals has been the focus of research on causal analysis of narratives (Black & Bower 1980, Schank & Abelson 1977, Trabasso & Sperry 1985).

[[Trabasso, T., & Sperry, L. L. (1985). Causal relatedness and importance of story events. Journal of Memory and language, 24(5), 595-611.]]

Very influential.

[[Schank, R. C., & Abelson, R. P. (2013). Scripts, plans, goals, and understanding: An inquiry into human knowledge structures. Psychology Press.]]

Over 19k citations, it's the script theory book. I don't want to be responsible for something of that scale.

[[Trabasso, T., & Van Den Broek, P. (1985). Causal thinking and the representation of narrative events. Journal of memory and language, 24(5), 612-630.]]

This is a causal networking paper focused on recall. Love it.
