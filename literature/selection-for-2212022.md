## Story Grammar Theory and Evidence
[[Bower, G. H. (1976). Experiments on Story Understanding and Recall. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 28(4), 511-534.]] Reviews some fascinating early narrative recall research, distinguishes separate effects of narrative structure and content on memory, introduces a paradigm for researching transfer effects in narrative memory.

[[Thorndyke, P. W. (1977). Cognitive Structures in Comprehension and Memory of Narrative Discourse. Cognitive Psychology, 9(1), 77-110.]]. Presents similar evidence as Bower (1976) but in more detail and with a fuller specification of the story grammar account of narrative understanding and memory.

[[Rumelhart, D. E. (1975). Notes on a Schema for Stories. In Representation and Understanding (Pp. 211-236). Morgan Kaufmann.]]. Probably the initial and fullest proposal of story grammar theory.

## Situation Model Theory and Evidence
[[Zwaan, R. A., & Radvansky, G. A. (1998). Situation models in language comprehension and memory. Psychological bulletin, 123(2), 162.]] Pretty full review of situation model theory and evidence by this point, with sections that remind me of Marr's (1982) emphasis on building a computational theory of a task. Also has an initial presentation of and argument for the influential Event-Indexing model of comprehension.

[[Rinck, M., & Bower, G. H. (1995). Anaphora resolution and the focus of attention in situation models. Journal of memory and language, 34(1), 110-131.]] Introduces and demonstrates paradigm for situation model research, documenting more evidence for situation-distance effects.

[[Dutke, S., Ribback, S., & Wagner, B. (2003). Direct distance, route distance, and implied temporal distance: Effects on the accessibility of situation model components. Scientific Studies of Reading, 7(4), 357-381.]] Reviews and independently replicates situation-space and situation-time comprehension effects maybe initially demonstrated by Rinck & Bower (2000), with some caveats.

[[McNamara, D. S., Kintsch, E., Songer, N. B., & Kintsch, W. (1996). Are Good Texts Always Better? Interactions of Text Coherence, Background Knowledge, and Levels of Understanding in Learning From Text. Cognition and Instruction, 14(1), 1-43.]] Rich set of experiments rooted in construction-integration theory characterizing interaction between background knowledge and text cohesion wrt text memory.

## Causal Connectivity Theory and Evidence
[[Black, J. B., & Bower, G. H. (1980). Story Understanding as Problem-Solving. Poetics, 9(1-3), 223-250.]] Constraint satisfaction seems to be the term for this framing in more recent work. Also has a complete evaluation of Story Grammar theory as a memory theory.

[[Trabasso, T., & Van Den Broek, P. (1985). Causal Thinking and the Representation of Narrative Events. Journal of Memory and Language, 24(5), 612-630.]] Analysis of immediate and delayed narrative free recall in context of story grammar and causal networking theory. 

[[Trabasso, T., & Langston, M. (1998). Modeling causal integration and availability of information during comprehension of narrative texts. The construction of mental representations during reading, 25.]] Integrates causal connectivity analysis within a hybrid connectionist architecture to implement and then evaluate a computational model of the Causal Network account narrative comprehension/memory across a collection of phenomena.

[[Dopkins, S., Klin, C., & Myers, J. L. (1993). Accessibility of Information About Goals During the Processing of Narrative Texts. Learning, Memory, 19(1), 70-80.]]

[[Lutz, M. F., & Radvansky, G. A. (1997). The Fate of Completed Goal Information in Narrative Comprehension. Journal of Memory and Language, 36(2), 293-310.]] Reviews and extends literature on effect of goal completion/non-completion on narrative memory.

## General
[[Bower, G. H. (2008). The evolution of a cognitive psychologist: A journey from simple behaviors to complex mental acts. Annu. Rev. Psychol., 59, 1-27]] Neat historical view threading together many lines of research.

[[McNamara, D. S., & Magliano, J. (2009). Toward a comprehensive model of comprehension. Psychology of learning and motivation, 51, 297-384.]] Thorough review of 7 prominent comprehension models (Construction–Integration, Structure-Building, Resonance, Event-Indexing, Causal Network, Constructionist, and Landscape) and corresponding empirical evidence supporting them.

[[O’Brien, E. J., & Cook, A. E. (2015). Models of discourse comprehension. Handbook on reading, 217-231.]] More recent review of comprehension models by authors of Resonance model of comprehension that draws a distinction between strategy- and memory-based models and their corresponding predictions about "necessary inferences, elaborative inferences, and the maintenance of global coherence". Strongly favors a memory-based view.

[[Hess, D. J., Foss, D. J., & Carroll, P. (1995). Effects of Global and Local Context on Lexical Processing During Language Comprehension. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 124(1), 62.]] Example of evidence in debate of role of local/global inference in comprehension processes and how they relate to key models.

# Neuroscientific Evidence
[[Yarkoni, T., Speer, N. K., & Zacks, J. M. (2008). Neural substrates of narrative comprehension and memory. Neuroimage, 41(4), 1408-1425.]] Applies fMRI imaging during narrative- and shuffled sentence- comprehension to examine theories of narrative comprehension in light of neurobiology, eventually endorsing a situation/Event-Indexing account of the process.

[[Kurby, C. A., & Zacks, J. M. (2013). The activation of modality-specific representations during discourse processing. Brain and language, 126(3), 338-349.]] Builds on pre-existing evidence of a concreteness effect in narrative memory, finding heightened activation of modality-specific representations during naturalistic reading of extended narratives compared to similar content presented in discrete clauses.

[[Yeshurun, Y., Swanson, S., Simony, E., Chen, J., Lazaridi, C., Honey, C. J., & Hasson, U. (2017). Same story, different story: the neural representation of interpretive frameworks. Psychological science, 28(3), 307-319.]] Using different introductory cues, authors biased subjects to interpret the same story in different ways. Story comprehension and neural responses in areas including default-mode network, language areas, and mirror neuron system found similar among participants with same interpretation, but different interpretations, with similarity scaling with extent of interpretive agreement. 

## Other Model-Focused Work
[[Gernsbacher, M. A. (1997). Two decades of structure building. Discourse processes, 23(3), 265-304.]] Characterizes and reviews evidence for Structure-Building model, including an body of evidence for various theory-constraining primacy effects in narrative comprehension and memory.

[[Van den Broek, P., Risden, K., Fletcher, C. R., & Thurlow, R. (1996). A “landscape” view of reading: Fluctuating patterns of activation and the construction of a stable memory representation. Models of understanding text, 165-187.]] Thorough presentation and case for a constraint-based connectionist "Landscape" account of narrative comprehension/memory that aims to account for a variety of benchmark effects in the literature.

[[Yeari, M., & van den Broek, P. (2016). A computational modeling of semantic knowledge in reading comprehension: Integrating the landscape model with latent semantic analysis. Behavior research methods, 48(3), 880-896.]] Specifies and examines a newer version of the Landscape model that integrates its processes with latent semantic analysis representation of background semantic knowledge and uses it to predict various inference, centrality, and offline recall effects.

[[Myers, J. L., & O'Brien, E. J. (1998). Accessing the discourse representation during reading. Discourse processes, 26(2-3), 131-157.]] Characterizes and reviews evidence for the memory-based "Resonance" model of comprehension, including an examination of evidence that readers can automatically retrieve temporally distant textual information to comprehend a text. 

[[Graesser, A. C., Singer, M., & Trabasso, T. (1994). Constructing inferences during narrative text comprehension. Psychological review, 101(3), 371.]] Lays out a theory of the kinds of memory-based inferences that readers make during text comprehension, taking a strategic/"top-down" account in contrast to other authors' preferred memory-/"bottom-up" account (e.g., O'Brien & Cook, 2015).

## Caveats
I can't find the PDF for @rumelhart1975notes even though it's a very influential paper in the Story Grammar genre. Can't engage with it until I do!
