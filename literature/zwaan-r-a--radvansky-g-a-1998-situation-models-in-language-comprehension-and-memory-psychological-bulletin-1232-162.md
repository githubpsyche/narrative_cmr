> This article reviews research on the use of situation models in language comprehension and memory retrieval over the past 15 years. Situation models are integrated mental representations of a described state of affairs. Significant progress has been made in the scientific understanding of how situation models are involved in language comprehension and memory retrieval. Much of this research focuses on establishing the existence of situation models, often by using tasks that assess one dimension of a situation model. However, the authors argue that the time has now come for researchers to begin to take the multidimensionality of situation models seriously. The authors offer a theoretical framework and some methodological observations that may help researchers to tackle this issue. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Ooh, a review paper by a guy who's not Bower.

## Why do we need situation models?

Models Are Needed to Integrate Information Across
Sentences

> Recently, Hess, Foss, and Carroll ( 1995 ) provided a powerful demonstration of the role of situation models in language processing. In a series of experiments, they found that the speed with which the last word of a sentence is named depends on how well it can be integrated with the current situation model rather than merely on its lexical associations to words prior to it in the sentence. These findings suggest that situation models have a strong and rather immediate effect on on-line comprehension

Is a sentence-comprehension effect but seems relevant.

Models Are Needed to Explain Similarities in
Comprehension Performance Across Modalities

When we read a newspaper article about a particular event,
we may come away with a similar understanding of that event
as when we had seen it in a news report on television

> There is empirical evidence that supports this intuition. Baggett (1979) found that students who saw a short film produced structurally similar recall protocols as students who heard a spoken version of the study that matched the movie in episodic structure. To be sure, there were differences in the recall protocols between the two groups, but these differences were due to content aspects

Not All Language Processing Tasks Involve Situation
Models 

These are great, well-evidenced arguments for the existence of situation models. Reminds me of the computational level in Marr's framework.

## Five Situational Dimensions

### Space

#### Foregrounding

> The spatial foregrounding of information was demonstrated in a study by Glenberg et al. ( 1987; see also Singer, Graesser, & Trabasso, 1994). In two experiments (Experiments 1 and 2), people read stories containing a critical object. In half the stories, this object was spatially associated with the protagonist ( "John put on his sweatshirt before going jogging" ), whereas in the other half, this object was spatially dissociated ("John took off his sweatshirt before going jogging" ). Two sentences after the critical sentence, the name of the critical object (e.g., sweatshirt) was presented, and people made recognition responses. Response latencies were longer in the dissociated than in the associated condition, even though the distance in the text was the same. In a third experiment, Glenberg et al. used a reading time paradigm with similar results. At a later point during the story, a sentence appeared that anaphorically referred back to the critical object (the sweatshirt). Reading times for that sentence were recorded. Glenberg et al. found that information spatially close to the protagonist, and hence more likely to be foregrounded in the situation model, led to faster reading times than information that was spatially separated. 

This is wild! And does a good job of dissociating foregrounding from semantic associative effects. What's this glenberg paper??

[[Glenberg, A. M., Meyer, M., & Lindem, K. (1987). Mental models contribute to foregrounding during text comprehension. Journal of memory and language, 26(1), 69-83.]]

#### Updating 
Ehrlich and Johnson-Laird (1982) found, consistent with the idea that readers construct and update spatial situation models, that people spent less time reading spatial descriptions when they were referentially continuous than referentially discontinuous. #[[Referential Continuity Effects]]

### Causation

### Intentionality (Aboutness)

### Protagonists and Objects

### Time

Paper proceeds to promote the Event-Indexing model. Oh, great. I have that covered now.

> We would argue that such a module would have to have the capability to (a) represent connections among situational nodes on different dimensions, such as time, space, causation, intentionality, and agency; and (b) capture the construction, foregrounding, updating, integration, and retrieval of situational information in the current model, the integrated model, and the complete model. These are interesting and important challenges for future research. 

I hope that's not true, but it might be.
