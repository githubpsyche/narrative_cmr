title: "Benchmarks for Models of Narrative Comprehension and Memory: Proposed Reading List"
abstract: "Ahead of my qualifying exam, I'm supposed to propose a reading list covering issues to address in the qualifying exam. Committee members can add or delete readings from the list and, more generally, will have input on the list of issues to be addressed. Here I propose a reading list focused on my intended MAP topic, benchmarks for models of narrative comprehension and memory."

## Identifying Benchmarks
> Oberauer, K., Lewandowsky, S., Awh, E., Brown, G. D., Conway, A., Cowan, N., ... & Ward, G. (2018). Benchmarks for models of short-term and working memory. Psychological bulletin, 144(9), 885. 

A useful guide for sorting between effects. Proposes three criteria for identifying "benchmark findings" that every theory in a field should be able to explain: "benchmarks should be reproducible, generalize across materials and methodological variations, and be theoretically informative". Applies these criteria to propose a set of benchmarks for theories and computational models of short-term and working memory, attempting to describe them in a theory-neutral way and rate them according to their priority for explanation. Following Oberauer et al (2018), we can generally regard a finding as theoretically informative if it has been credibly used to make a case in favor or against a theoretical proposal. So theoretically focused papers are an important component of this review, and are useful for identifying influential findings in general. So this reference list is generally organized by theoretical orientation, with patterns used to justify theoretical proposals highlighted in annotations.

## General Reviews
> McNamara, D. S., & Magliano, J. (2009). Toward a comprehensive model of comprehension. Psychology of learning and motivation, 51, 297-384. 

Thorough review and comparison of 7 prominent comprehension models (Construction–Integration, Structure-Building, Resonance, Event-Indexing, Causal Network, Constructionist, and Landscape) and corresponding empirical evidence and theoretical debates surrounding them. A very useful nexus paper.

> Bower, G. H. (2008). The evolution of a cognitive psychologist: A journey from simple behaviors to complex mental acts. Annu. Rev. Psychol., 59, 1-27 

Reviews development of narrative comprehension/memory research over course of Bower's career. Reviews and presents a concise critique of story grammar approach and evidence. Reviews evidence for situation model account of comprehension and memory and concludes by articulating a connectionist account of the process and explaining how a comprehension model developed in that framework might account for corresponding situation distance effects.

## Story Grammar Approach
Starts with schema-theoretic idea that (simple) stories have a "a constant set of abstract constituents such as a setting, characters, a plot, episodes, a resolution, and so on, all of which are put together in a principled way so as to make a coherent whole." (Bower, 1976). With respect to memory, hypothesizes ideas such as that more coherent stories are better remembered and that propositions tied to higher-order story-grammatical elements are better remembered than those tied to lower-order ones.

> Rumelhart, D. E. (1975). Notes on a schema for stories. In Representation and understanding (pp. 211-236). Morgan Kaufmann. 

Probably the original/authoritative presentation of story grammar theory, cited wherever it's discussed. Awfully hard to actually find the text, though.

> Thorndyke, P. W. (1977). Cognitive Structures in Comprehension and Memory of Narrative Discourse. Cognitive Psychology, 9(1), 77-110. 

A detailed presentation of the story grammar theory; also reports three influential memory experiments relating story memory to story coherence, story concreteness, participant-rated proposition importance, and primed story structural and/or content familiarity. Some cool transfer learning experiments that are fascinating but that I haven't seen followed up on by other authors.

> Bower, G. H. (1976).periments on Story Understanding and Recall. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 28(4), 511-534. 

Presents a high-level review of ideas and results in Thorndyke (1977) and relates them to broader developmental and process-based hypotheses about comprehension that over time have grown more influential than story-grammar theories. Emphasizes inference processes (especially bridging inferences) during reading as an important theoretical constraint.

## Comprehension as Building a Situation Model
Starts with idea that along with building a representation of the text itself and its propositions, readers also build a representation of the situation described by the text, including temporal, spatial, causal, and motivational dimensions as well as person- and object-related information. While processing a narrative, readers are focused on a subset of their currently constructed situation model, and the retrievability of information -- as measured by reading time, inference content, response time to probes, transitions during free recall,  and so on -- is a function of the situational distance or relevance of the target information from or to what's in narrative focus. Also emphasizes a role of background knowledge separate from the text base in construction of situation representations of narratives and thus also their retrieval.

> Zwaan, R. A., & Radvansky, G. A. (1998). Situation models in language comprehension and memory. Psychological bulletin, 123(2), 162. 

Reviews 15 years of of research on use of situation models in narrative comprehension and memory research. Motivates situation models as a theoretical construct with several arguments, and thoroughly reviews evidence for comprehension/memory effects along five "situational dimensions", including space, time, causation, intentionality (i.e. goal-relevance), and protagonists/objects. Briefly summarizes the influential Event-Indexing model of comprehension and presents some predictions such as that 1) the processing load during comprehension varies as a function of the number of "situational indexes" shared between the currently processed event and the current state of the situation model, 2) the strengths of the interconnections between memory nodes coding for story events will vary with the number of shared event indexes between these event. Also discusses limitations.

> Kintsch, W., & Walter Kintsch, C. B. E. M. A. F. R. S. (1998). Comprehension: A paradigm for cognition. Cambridge university press. 

Manuscript presenting the highly influential construction-integration model of comprehension that conceptualizes the process as a two-stage process: first, approximate, inaccurate representations are constructed via context insensitive construction rules, which are then integrated via a spreading activation constraint satisfaction process. Reviews history of work developing three-level view of narrative representation (text base, propositional, situation model), including interesting empirical patterns occurring at each level. Relates theory to leading theoretical problems in comprehension research at the time.

> Rinck, M., & Bower, G. H. (1995). Anaphora resolution and the focus of attention in situation models. Journal of memory and language, 34(1), 110-131. 

Investigated through 4 experiments how the accessibility of a referent for an anaphoric noun phrase decreases with the spatial distance of the referent from the focus of attention. Example of influential evidence and methodology supporting situation model account of comprehension, at least along spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatial distance effect depends more on number of rooms/transitions between target and current narrative focus than the metric distance between target and focus. Results largely replicated in other work, e.g.:

> Dutke, S., Ribback, S., & Wagner, B. (2003). Direct distance, route distance, and implied temporal distance: Effects on the accessibility of situation model components. Scientific Studies of Reading, 7(4), 357-381. 

Reviews and independently replicates situation-space and situation-time comprehension effects maybe initially demonstrated by Rinck & Bower (2000), with some caveats.

> McNamara, D. S., Kintsch, E., Songer, N. B., & Kintsch, W. (1996). Are Good Texts Always Better? Interactions of Text Coherence, Background Knowledge, and Levels of Understanding in Learning From Text. Cognition and Instruction, 14(1), 1-43. 

Classic demonstration of how background knowledge interacts with text cohesion to influence comprehension and memory outcomes. Finds readers who know little about the domain of the text benefit from a coherent text, whereas high-knowledge readers benefit from a minimally coherent text. Further distinguishes between levels of understanding/memory, arguing that "free-recall measure and text-based questions primarily tapped readers' superficial understanding of the text, while the inference questions, problem-solving questions, and sorting task relied on a situational understanding of the text." Explains results in terms of "active" vs "passive" processing.

> Yarkoni, T., Speer, N. K., & Zacks, J. M. (2008). Neural substrates of narrative comprehension and memory. Neuroimage, 41(4), 1408-1425. 

Reviews body of research applying fMRI to understand narrative comprehension. Applies fMRI imaging during narrative- and shuffled sentence- comprehension to examine theories of narrative comprehension in light of neurobiology. "Most brain regions that showed modulation of activation during narrative-level comprehension were also modulated to a lesser extent during sentence-level comprehension, suggesting a shared reliance on general coherence-building mechanisms". Alternatively identifies other regions such as posterior parietal cortex as associated with construction and maintainance of situation models. Observes strong comprehension and mnemonic benefit of story coherence. PPC activation exhibited  large increase from baseline at block onset, a pattern connected to initial construction of a situation model. Activation decreased markedly in the story condition but remained relatively elevated in the scrambled condition. Authors explain this difference in terms of the Structure-Building and Event-Indexing frameworks: under high story coherence, "each incremental sentence should require relatively few adjustments to the global situation model, because there is little discrepancy between the current and global model". On the other hand, asserts that slower reading times associated with initial story sentences are attributable specifically to visuospatial updating processes rather than to a non-specific increase in the amount of "cognitive effort" required for "foundation-laying" as posited by Structure-Building theory. Connections drawn between results and theories seem speculative, overall.

## Causal Networking
Emphasizes role of causal relationships in comprehension and centered around a principled system of discourse analysis for theoretically identifying relationships between story clauses. Initially assumes that there are four types of causal relationships: enabling, psychological, motivational, and physical, effectively asserting that causal- and goal-related connections in narratives are the same phenomenon. Hypothesizes that more causally connected ideas are more likely to be remembered and considered important, and that connectivity to items in narrative focus corresponds with retrievability.

> Black, J. B., & Bower, G. H. (1980). Story Understanding as Problem-Solving. Poetics, 9(1-3), 223-250. 

A hierarchical problem solving account of comprehension and memory effects. Model itself isn't too influential, but reader-goal-driven constraint satisfaction has become a common principle of most influential models in the literature. Relates models to benchmarks surrounding the relevance of causality and intentionality to narrative comprehension and memory. 

> Trabasso, T., & Van Den Broek, P. (1985). Causal Thinking and the Representation of Narrative Events. Journal of Memory and Language, 24(5), 612-630. 

Demonstrates how to derive causal network representations of various stories and derives from them predictions about immediate and delayed narrative free recall, summarization, and judged event importance. Using multiple regression, finds that whether or not an event was in a causal chain and the number of its causal connections accounts for much common and unique variance across all four measures. Also finds that story grammar analyses substantially overlap with causal. Found that concreteness, serial position, and argument overlap failed to account uniquely for the data. 

> Trabasso, T., & Langston, M. (1998). Modeling causal integration and availability of information during comprehension of narrative texts. The construction of mental representations during reading, 25. 

Integrates causal connectivity analysis within a hybrid connectionist architecture to implement and then evaluate a computational model of the Causal Network account of narrative comprehension/memory across a collection of phenomena. Emphasizes five types of data for model evaluation:  (a) time taken to integrate sentences into a text representation (reading time), (b) availability of antecedents during integration (think aloud protocol), (c) availability of antecedents retrieved during integration (sentence verification time, word naming time), (d) judgments based on integration (importance ranking of sentences, rating of causal relatedness), and (e) memory for what was integrated into the text representation (cued recall, immediate and delayed free sentence recall, "whole story" recall). Model's performance was strong for some measures, mixed or weak for others.

> Dopkins, S., Klin, C., & Myers, J. L. (1993). Accessibility of Information About Goals During the Processing of Narrative Texts. Learning, Memory, 19(1), 70-80. 

Reports evidence that a goal established earlier in a text is active in memory at the point of achievement. Follow-up experiments attempt to rule out candidate explanations focused on encoding strength, goal representation maintenance in working memory, and goal reinstatement in memory through global inference. Concludes that links between goals and outcomes in narratives are resolved locally, similarly to anaphora, supporting the minimalist hypothesis about inferences during reading.

> Lutz, M. F., & Radvansky, G. A. (1997). The Fate of Completed Goal Information in Narrative Comprehension. Journal of Memory and Language, 36(2), 293-310. 

Reviews and extends literature on effect of goal completion/non-completion on narrative memory. In contrast to other work, examines how goal information is extinguished from narrative focus when a goal is completed. Reports evidence that completed goal information remains more available than neutral information after goal completion instead of decaying to baseline or being suppressed. Results are interpreted as providing evidence for a constructionist (non-minimalist) account of inference during reading that suppose failed goals should be more available in memoroy than successful goals, "because they are unsatisfied". 

## Landscape Model
A connectionist model combining cohort activation, coherence-based retrieval, and a delta learning rule over the course of reading to unite assumptions from competing models (Construction-Integration, Resonance, Constructionist) and account for a wide variety of findings. Relevant connection weights and analysis units are theoretically unconstrained, with model more focused on characterizing how connections evolve over the course of reading. Predicts that connectivity corresponds with availability in memory. 

> Van den Broek, P., Risden, K., Fletcher, C. R., & Thurlow, R. (1996). A “landscape” view of reading: Fluctuating patterns of activation and the construction of a stable memory representation. Models of understanding text, 165-187. 

Complete presentation of landscape model casting comprehension as "a landscape of fluctuating activations" driven by connections in a network of concept nodes. Proposes that comprehension outcomes and the kinds of inferences made depend on readers' standards of coherence, which can vary based on situation and the individual. Simulated model (with no parameter fitting) correlated strongly with participants' ratings of conceptual importance, moderately with conceptual recall rates, and could predict probability of first, second, and third recall. Inferences, primacy, and other patterns are emergent from model dynamics.

> Yeari, M., & van den Broek, P. (2016). A computational modeling of semantic knowledge in reading comprehension: Integrating the landscape model with latent semantic analysis. Behavior research methods, 48(3), 880-896. 

Specifies and examines a newer version of the Landscape model that integrates its processes with LSA-derived word vector representation of background semantic knowledge and conceptual relatedness. Applies model to predict various inference, centrality, and offline recall effects. Only moderately successful; facially hard to determine if limitations are due to the model of semantic associations or of comprehension itself. More sophisticated model evaluation techniques common in my research area not leveraged.

## Discontinuity/Primacy Effects
> Gernsbacher, M. A. (1997). Two decades of structure building. Discourse processes, 23(3), 265-304. 

Characterizes and reviews evidence for Structure-Building model. The structure building framework proposes that comprehension involves laying down a structural foundation, mapping new information to the structure, and shifting to a new structure or substructure when incoming information is unrelated to previous information. At center of theory is a body of evidence for various theory-constraining primacy effects in narrative comprehension and memory. "Subjects in sentence-by-sentence reading time experiments spent more time reading the first sentence in a paragraph than sentences that occur later. Subjects also spent more time reading the first sentence of each episode within a story than sentences that occurred later in that episode. Similarly, when subjects read independent sentences (sentences not embedded in a story), they spent more time reading the first word of each sentence than words that occurred later." Also proposes mechanisms for adaptive suppression of activated information when they lose relevance to the structure being built. 

> Cirilo, R. K., & Foss, D. J. (1980). Text structure and reading time for sentences. Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 19(1), 96-109. 

Example of research relating reading time to "serial position" within sentences and stories. Also finds longer reading times for story elements at higher "hierarchical levels", using the story grammar conceptualization.

> Gernsbacher, M. A., Hargreaves, D. J., & Beeman, M. (1989). Building and accessing clausal representations: The advantage of first mention versus the advantage of clause recency. Journal of memory and language, 28(6), 735-755. 

Discusses an additional Advantage of First-Mentioned Participant where participants mentioned first in a sentence are more accessible than participants mentioned second. Contrasts this with the Advantage of the Most Recent Clause (concepts mentioned in the most recent clause are more accessible than concepts mentioned in an earlier clause). The Advantage of the Most Recent Clause is strongest immediately after reading a sentence while the Advantage of First-Mentioned Participant is more enduring.

> Gernsbacher, M. A., & Faust, M. E. (1991). The mechanism of suppression: a component of general comprehension skill. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 17(2), 245. 

Part of series of experiments concluding that less-skilled comprehenders are less efficient at suppressing irrelevant or inappropriate information but not enhancing relevant information. Finds weaker suppression of incorrect forms of homonyms, typical-but-absent objects in scenes, and information across modalities.

> Baldassano, C., Chen, J., Zadbood, A., Pillow, J. W., Hasson, U., & Norman, K. A. (2017). Discovering event structure in continuous narrative perception and memory. Neuron, 95(3), 709-721. 

An important bridge between research areas of event segmentation and narrative comprehension/memory.Using a novel model of cortical event dynamics, authors investigated how cortical structures generate event representations during narrative perception and how these events are stored to and retrieved from memory. They identified separate representations of short events in sensory regions and long events in higher-order areas. Higher-order event boundaries correspond with heightened hippocampus activation, and the scale of this evoked response predicted extent of the event's reinstatement during free recall.

## The Minimalist/Constructionist Debate About Inference
> McKoon, G., & Ratcliff, R. (1992). Inference during reading. Psychological review, 99(3), 440. 

Echoing reviews I've found elsewhere, distinguishes between constructionist and minimalist views about the inferences readers make during comprehension. According to the minimalist stance promoted by these authors, "the only inferences that are encoded automatically during reading are those based on easily available information and those rquired to make statements in the text locally coherent". Constructionist accounts conversely suggest that automatic inferences can be triggered to enforce global coherence of the text's situation model. These are relevant for memory research because 1) inferences are generally understood as a cue retrieval operation and 2) they help determine the ongoing structure of the representation built during comprehension. Presents 5 experiments observing local but not global causal inferences during reading, and relates theoretical dilemma to influential theories in the literature.

> O’Brien, E. J., & Cook, A. E. (2015). Models of discourse comprehension. Handbook on reading, 217-231. 

More recent review of comprehension models by proponents of Resonance modelthat draws a distinction between strategy- and memory-based models and their corresponding predictions about "necessary inferences, elaborative inferences, and the maintenance of global coherence". "Strategy-based" models match with the constructionist account of inference discussed in other reviews, while "memory-based" models lean toward the minimalist hypothesis. Strongly favors a localist, memory-based view. However, it remains unclear whether this categorization is apt.

> Myers, J. L., & O'Brien, E. J. (1998). Accessing the discourse representation during reading. Discourse processes, 26(2-3), 131-157. 

Characterizes and reviews evidence for the memory-based "Resonance" model of comprehension, including an examination of evidence that readers can automatically retrieve temporally distant textual information to comprehend a text. Proposes that  concepts and propositions in th e discourse representation resonate in response to related elements in the current sentence, enabling retrieval of distant information via a memory-based process (e.g. the echo of an instance-based model) rather than strategy-based search. Concludes with a critique of constructionist and causal networking accounts of memory.

> Graesser, A. C., Singer, M., & Trabasso, T. (1994). Constructing inferences during narrative text comprehension. Psychological review, 101(3), 371. 

Focused presentation of a constructionist account of narrative comprehension that embraces a principle of a search/effort after meaning where readers attempt to build a representation of the text  that is coherent at both local and global levels. Describes thirteen types of inferences that readers can make and reviews evidence for controversial and uncontroversial commitments of the theory.

## Reconstructive Memory
Another body of research exploring the influence of previous knowledge on narrative recall focuses on how background knowledge and reader goals can distort recall of story details during reconstruction.

> Bartlett, F. C., & Bartlett, F. C. (1932). Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology. 

Among many experiments, Bartlett read his subjects the native American folktale, "The War of the Ghosts." After hearing the story read twice, subjects were given a 15-min delay and then tried to recall the story. After this first recall, subjects were tested again at some later point in time. Identified patterns in recall errors/distortions such as "conventionalization" where foreign cultural elements are transformed towards familiar patterns when they enter a recipient group.

> Bergman, E. T., & Roediger, H. L. (1999). Can Bartlett’s repeated reproduction experiments be replicated?. Memory & cognition, 27(6), 937-947. 

Independently replicates Bartlett (1932) and contextualizes it with then-modern research. More deeply explores how patterns of errors evolve with increasing delays between study and recall.

> Marsh, E. J. (2007). Retelling is not the same as recalling: Implications for memory. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 16(1), 16-20. 

Distinguishes narrative recall under controlled experimental conditions from narrative retelling that can "depend on the speaker's goals, the audience, and the social context more generally". Reviews evidence that "selective rehearsal" as well as "the schema activated" during narrative retelling can distort memory of a narrative in ways contigent on social circumstance.

## Basic Memory Search Research
Basic research focused on memory search tends to involve study of word lists instead of coherent narratives, but can provide important background for interpretation of retrieval effects in comprehension research.

> Kahana, M. J. (2020). Computational models of memory search. Annual Review of Psychology, 71, 107-138.
> Polyn, S. M., Norman, K. A., & Kahana, M. J. (2009). A context maintenance and retrieval model of organizational processes in free recall. Psychological review, 116(1), 129.
> Morton, N. W., & Polyn, S. M. (2016). A predictive framework for evaluating models of semantic organization in free recall. Journal of memory and language, 86, 119-140.
> Hintzman, D. L. (1984). MINERVA 2: A simulation model of human memory. Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers, 16(2), 96-101.

Kahana (2020) reviews central ideas and benchmark findings investigated by memory search theorists. Polyn, Norman & Kahana (2009) and Morton & Polyn (2016) more comprehensively present an in-house/familiar general account of memory search and a framework for evaluating models of memory search that emphasize temporal and semantic information in study materials that may be useful for interpreting my review. By exploring and contextualizing models of how semantic knowledge influences memory search in the list recall paradigm, Morton et al (2016) helps bridge between narrative recall research and the broader memory search literature. Phenomena reviewed across all these references helps relate primacy and recency effects emphasized in Structure Building accounts of narrative comprehension to broader principles of memory. Patterns in transitions made during free recall are relatively neglected in narrative memory research, but are emphasized as a central theoretical constraint in list memory research. Hintzman (1984) outlines an alternative framework for modeling memory processes that has been influential in some accounts of comprehension, especially the Resonance model.

> Kurby, C. A., & Zacks, J. M. (2013). The activation of modality-specific representations during discourse processing. Brain and language, 126(3), 338-349. 

Builds on pre-existing evidence of a concreteness effect in narrative memory, finding heightened activation of modality-specific representations during naturalistic reading of extended narratives compared to similar content presented in discrete clauses.

Using different introductory cues, authors biased subjects to interpret the same story in different ways. Story comprehension and neural responses in areas including default-mode network, language areas, and mirror neuron system found similar among participants with same interpretation, but different interpretations, with similarity scaling with extent of interpretive agreement.
