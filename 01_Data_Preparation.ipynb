    "Most of our analyses don't work directly on the text data we preprocess above. Instead, we want something formatted more like the traditional object of free recall modeling: sequences of study events and recall events related based on item identity, serial position, and other task features. \n",

    "We'll follow the approach of the [Psifr library](https://psifr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and represent most of our data in a long table format, with each row corresponding to a study or recall event and tracking for each event a subject index, a trial index, an input or output position, and item id. To identify items, we'll just use the text of the corresponding source unit either studied or recalled. \n",
